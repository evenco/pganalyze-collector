# Changelog

## 0.16.0      2018-10-16

* Fix scoping of on-disk state to reflect system type/scope/id
  * Previously we only considered API key to determine which state to save,
    which meant that in configurations with multiple servers but a single
    organization API key we'd usually loose statistics on restarts, or
    get the wrong values for diff-ing the query statistics
  * This is a backwards-incompatible change for the on-disk format and
    therefore bumps the version from 1 to 2. Effectively this will show
    as one period of no data after upgrading to this version, as the
    previously saved counter values in the state file won't be used
* Add support for "%t [%p]: [%l-1] user=%u,db=%d,app=%a,client=%h " log_line_prefix
* Use explicit log file clean up instead of deferrals
  * There have been reports of old temporary files containing log lines
    not being cleaned up fully - attempt to fix that
* systemd config: Fix incorrect specification of memory limit & restart event [Dom Hutton](https://github.com/Dombo) [#26](https://github.com/pganalyze/collector/pull/26)


## 0.15.2      2018-09-28

* Fix supported log_line_prefix list to include recently added prefixes


## 0.15.1      2018-09-28

* Add additional supported log_line_prefix settings
  * '%t [%p]: [%l-1] user=%u,db=%d - PG-%e '
* Add new log classifications
  * WAL_BASE_BACKUP_COMPLETE
  * SERVER_STATS_COLLECTOR_TIMEOUT
* Add "sorry, too many clients already" out of connections log classification


## 0.15.0      2018-09-27

* Add additional supported log_line_prefix settings
  * 1) '%m [%p] %q[user=%u,db=%d,app=%a] '
  * 2) '%m [%p] %q[user=%u,db=%d,app=%a,host=%h] '
* Add support for [local] when using %r in log_line_prefix
* Make --discover-log-location work when using monitoring user
* Correctly detect pg_wal directory for Postgres 10 and newer
* Introduce setting for maximum collector connections
  * This previously existed as a hard-coded 5 connection maximum based on the
    pganalyze-collector application name in pg_stat_activity
  * Adds "max_collector_connections" configuration setting to override
  * Increases default max connections to 10 to better support activity snapshots
  * Writes an error to the log instead of panicing when limit is reached
* Add experimental support for Docker log monitoring
  * Adds "db_log_docker_tail" setting to specify the container name
  * Allows monitoring the logs of a Postgres instance running inside
    Docker, when running the collector outside (on the Docker Host)


## 0.14.4      2018-08-23

* Add support for Postgres 11
* Support log_hostname=1 when using log_line_prefix that contains %r
* Duplicate config detection: Differentiate by API key and API base url


## 0.14.3      2018-08-08

* Add configuration setting to disable high-frequency query statistics


## 0.14.2      2018-07-21

* Log parser: Add support for offset-based timezone identifier
  - Previously we assumed that Postgres always outputs the timezone name,
    that is not correct for some timezones, where instead an offset like
    "+0100" would be printed.


## 0.14.1      2018-07-18

* Fixes to experimental sequences report
* Document monitoring helper functions for sequences report


## 0.14.0      2018-07-15

* Introduce once-per-minute query statistics collection
  - Enabled for PostgreSQL 9.4+
  - This replaces the old logic for query stats without text (statement_text_frequency),
    and is always active
  - Statistics data gets sent with every full snapshot
* Backend counts: Support retrieving stats for Postgres 9.5 and older
* Log Insights: Add support for detecting aggressive vacuums (Postgres 11+)
* Parse serialization failure log events (U138 and U139)
* Have systemd restart the collector after crashes [Dom Hutton](https://github.com/Dombo) [#23](https://github.com/pganalyze/collector/pull/23)

* Add additional log classifications, speed up analysis by reusing regexps
* Add "--analyze-logfile" option to test collector with local logfiles
* Associate truncated queries to the correct error fingerprint
* Update to Go 1.9.3


## 0.10.0      2017-10-31

* Update pg_query_go to Postgres 10 and fingerprint version 2
  - This is a breaking change in collector output, as queries will now
    be fingerprinted differently
* Activity snapshots
  - Use pg_stat_activity helper when it exists
  - Track VACUUM progress in activity snapshots
  - Activity data: Ignore backends that are not visible to the user
  - Allow additional digits for PID in pg_stat_activity [Joseph Bylund](https://github.com/jbylund)
* Don't collect backend data for full snapshot anymore, this is all delegated
  to activity snapshots now
* Update to Go 1.9.2
* RDS pgss check: Add additional safety against nil pointer dereferences


## 0.9.17      2017-10-09

* Logs: Fix regexp for 9.5 vacuum output (skip pins, but not skip frozen)
* Update to Go 1.9.1 release
* Allow disabling collection of relation/schema information
* Add experimental activity snapshots
  - This is not for public consumption yet, and trying to use it will result in
    an error from the server - but watch this space :)


## 0.9.16      2017-10-05

* Support for Postgres 10 monitoring role
* Log Insights improvements
  - Fix bug where referenced query wouldn't be correctly identified
  - Collect query text and parameters for all query samples
  - Fix issues with Heroku Postgres log collection


## 0.9.15      2017-10-01

* Update pg_query_go / libpg_query to 9.5-1.6.2
  * Updates the query fingerprinting logic to avoid seeing different
    FETCH/DECLARE/CLOSE cursor names as unique queries - statistics on this
    are not going to be useful in most cases, and will clog the processing
    pipeline
  * Updates the query fingerprinting logic to ignore the table name for
    CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE
  * Updates the query fingerprinting logic to better handle the values list
    for INSERT statements to group complex, but similar statements together
* Support specifying db_sslmode=verify-full and passing certificate information
  using db_sslrootcert / db_sslrootcert_contents
  * The collector packages now also ship a set of known DB-as-a-Service CA
    certificates, starting with the often needed rds-ca-2015-root certificate
    (just pass that term instead of a path to db_sslrootcert)
* Support for Postgres 10
* Heroku: Support specifying configuration name in log drain endpoints
* RDS: Ensure to delete temporary log files quickly after they are submitted

## 0.9.0       2016-07-14

* First official release of new protocol buffers-based collector


## 0.9.0rc8    2016-07-08

  * We're now sending data using the protocol buffers format
  * Snapshot data is directly uploaded to S3
* Query, table and system statistics are diff-ed on the client side
* Support for monitoring system metrics on self-hosted systems is added again
* New safety mechanisms against stuck/slow collector runs


## 0.9.0rc7    2016-04-14

## 0.9.0rc6    2016-04-07

* Bugfixes for AWS Instance Role handling


## 0.9.0rc5    2016-04-07

* Introduce new --diff-statements option (default off for now)
  * This calculates the diff for the counter values of pg_stat_statements on the client (i.e. collector),
    instead of the server for increased accuracy and protection against out-of-order processing
* Introduce "opts" to the snapshot, for indicating which options were chosen

* Send Postgres version to the server as well


## 0.9.0rc2    2016-03-27

* Add --test mode to ease initial setup
* Don't do an initial run when daemonizing (the default), this is mostly so we
  can keep a clean schedule and prevent issues if the config is temporarily wrong,
  or the server is unreachable for some reason
* Use POSIX commandline flags (double dash instead of single dash, shorthand flags)
  instead of Go's flag approach
* Added support for specifying sslmode when connecting, and default to "prefer"
   * This also fixes an issue where beforehand we required SSL to always be present
   * For maximum security you might want to set this to "require" or "verify-full"
* Re-introduced all required statistics currently used by pganalyze


## 0.9.0rc1    2016-03-22

* Initial Go re-release
* The collector now runs as a daemon (instead of through the crontab)
* We optionally write a pidfile, which you can use to SIGHUP for config changes
* You can specify multiple databases in the configuration file
* Support for fetching Amazon Web Service RDS data (CloudWatch and log files)
